     the types inferred for the actual arguments of the lambda expression;
     that is, unlike at the top level, at intermediate levels
     variables receive the types inferred for their binding terms.
     Here `updated' means that
     the new alist is appended before the existing one:
     recall that, due to the pre-translation step
     that removes trivial lambda-bound variables,
     lambda expressions may not be closed at this point;
     thus, the appending achieves the desired ``overwriting''.")

    "The @('required-type?') input specifies
     the type required for the term, if any.
     At the top level (see @(tsee atj-type-annotate-formals+body)),
     this is the output type of the function:
     the body of the function must have the output type of the function.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The result of annotating a term is not only the annotated term,
     but also the type of the wrapped term.
     This is always the same as the required type when there is a required type;
     when there is no required type,
     the resulting type is the one inferred for the term.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The type inferred for a variable is the one assigned by @('var-types').
     We annotate the variable with its type;
     note that the variable names in @('var-types')
     do not have type annotations.
     We wrap the variable with a type conversion function
     from the inferred type to the required type if supplied,
     or to the inferred type (i.e. no-op conversion) if not supplied.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The type inferred for a quoted constant
     is determined by the value of the quoted constant.
     We wrap the quoted constant with a type conversion function
     as discussed above.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The non-strict function @(tsee if) is treated specially,
     because eventually it is translated to a Java @('if'),
     which assigns either the `then' part or the `else' part
     to a Java local variable.
     The type of the Java local variable is @('required-type?') if supplied:
     in this case, when @('required-type?') is recursively passed
     to the second and third argument of the @(tsee if),
     both terms will be wrapped so that they have the required type.
     However, if @('required-type?') is @('nil'),
     the recursive annotation of the `then' and `else' subterms
     may produce different types,
     and so in this case we re-wrap those terms
     with the least upper bound of the two types,
     according to the partial order on ATJ types.
     The case of a term of the form @('(if a a b)')
     is treated a little differently,
     but there is no substantial difference.
     In the general case @('(if a b c)') with @('a') different from @('b'),
     there is never any required type for the test @('a'),
     because in the Java code it is just used
     to generate the test of the @('if').
     In all cases, the @(tsee if) is wrapped with
     the identify conversion function for the overall type,
     for uniformity and to readily indicate the type
     of the Java local variable to generate.")
   (xdoc::p
    "For a lambda expression,
     the argument terms are annotated without required types.
     The inferred types are then assigned to the formal parameters
     when the body of the lambda expression is annotated.
     We annotate all the formal parameters of the lambda expression;
     but note that the new @('var-types') has non-annotated variable names.")
   (xdoc::p
    "For a named function call, the function's types are obtained.
     If there is just a primary function type,
     the input types become the required ones for the argument terms,
     while the output type is the one inferred for the call,
     which is then wrapped as needed to match the required type if any.
     However, if there are one or more secondary function types,
     we first try annotating the argument terms without required types
     (as done for a lambda expression as explained above),
     thus inferring types for the arguments.
     Then we look for the secondary function types
     whose input types are wider than or the same as
     the inferred argument types.
     If there are none, we fall back to using the primary function type,
     as if there were no secondary function types.
     If there are some, we select the one whose input types are the least;
     this should always exist because of the closure property
     checked by @(tsee def-atj-other-function-type);
     see the documentation of that macro and supporting functions for details.
     We then use the output type of the selected secondary function type
     as the type inferred for the function call,
     and wrap it to adapt to the required type for the function call if any.
     The successful selection of a secondary function type means that,
     in the translated Java code, an overloaded method will be called
     based on the argument types inferred by the Java compiler.")

    "Marking a variable as `new' is always ``safe'',
     because it is always safe to introduce a new Java local variable.
     On the other hand, marking a variable as `old' requires care,
     to prevent a Java local variable may be erroneously reused.
     To understand this marking algorithm,
     one has to keep in mind how ACL2 terms are translated to Java:
     see @(tsee atj-gen-shallow-term) and companions.
     This is a delicate algorithm:
     a proof of correctness would be very beneficial.")
   (xdoc::p
    "Two conditions are necessary for reusing a variable:
     (i) the variable must be in scope (i.e. exists and be accessible); and
     (ii) the previous value of the variable must not be used afterwards.
     The parameters @('vars-in-scope') and @('vars-used-after')
     support the checking of these conditions.")
   (xdoc::p
    "The parameter @('vars-in-scope') consists of the variables in scope
     at the point where the term under consideration occurs.
     At the top level (see @(tsee atj-mark-formals+body)),
     it is intialized with the (unmarked) formal parameters
     of the ACL2 function whose formal parameters and body are being marked:
     indeed, the formal parameters of a function are in scope for the body.
     As we descend into subterms, when we encounter a lambda expression,
     we extend @('vars-in-scope') with its (unmarked) formal parameters;
     only the ones that are marked as `new' actually extend the scope,
     while the ones marked as `old' were already in @('vars-in-scope').
     The generated Java code evaluates functions' actual arguments
     left-to-right:
     thus, local variables introduced (for lambda expressions in) an argument
     are generally (see exception shortly) in scope for successive arguments.
     Therefore, @('vars-in-scope') is threaded through the marking functions
     (i.e. passed as argument and returned, possibly updated, as result).
     When processing a lambda expression applied to arguments,
     @('vars-in-scope') is threaded first through the arguments,
     and then through the body (which is evaluated after the argument),
     after augmenting it with the formal parameters.
     The exception mentioned above is for @(tsee if),
     which is turned into a Java @('if')
     whose branches are Java blocks:
     Java variables declared inside these blocks
     have a more limited scope (namely, the respective block),
     and therefore should not be added to the @('vars-in-scope')
     that is passed to mark terms after the @(tsee if).
     The variables introduced in the test of the @(tsee if)
     are declared outside the branches' blocks,
     and so they are threaded through.
     The @('vars-in-scope') resulting from marking the test of the @(tsee if)
     is passed to mark both branches,
     but their returned @('vars-in-scope') is ignored.
     The code for @(tsee if) is a bit more complicated
     because of the special treatment of @('(if a a b)') terms,
     which are treated as @('(or a b)'):
     the Java code generated for this case is a little different
     (see @(tsee atj-gen-shallow-orapp)),
     but the treatment of @('vars-in-scope')
     is essentially the same as just explained
     (there is no `then' branch to mark, because it is the same as the test,
     which has already been marked).")
   (xdoc::p
    "The parameter @('vars-used-after') consists of the variables
     that occur free (i.e. whose current value is used)
     ``after'' the term under consideration.
     At the top level (see @(tsee atj-mark-formals+body)),
     it is initialized with @('nil'),
     because no variables are used after evaluating the body of the function.
     As we descend into subterms,
     @('vars-used-after') is extended as needed,
     based on the ``neighboring'' subterms
     that will be evaluated (in the generated Java code)
     after the subterm under consideration.
     In particular, when marking an actual argument of a function call,
     @('vars-used-after') is extended with all the free variables
     of the actual arguments of the same function call
     that occur after the one being marked;
     recall that arguments are evaluated left-to-right
     in the generated Java code.
     The function @('atj-mark-terms'),
     which is used to mark the actual arguments of a function call,
     augments @('vars-used-after') with the free variables
     in the @(tsee cdr) of the current list of arguments;
     this is somewhat inefficient,
     as the same free variables are collected repeatedly
     as the argument terms are processed,
     but terms are not expected to be too large in the short term;
     this will be optimized when needed.
     Calls of @(tsee if) are treated a little differently,
     because the arguments are not evaluated left-to-right
     in the generated Java code:
     when marking the test, we augment @('vars-used-after')
     with all the free variables in the branches;
     when marking either branch, we use the same @('vars-used-after')
     that was passed for the @(tsee if),
     because the two branches are independent.
     The @(tsee or) form of @(tsee if) is treated slightly differently as usual,
     but the essence is the same.
     Unlike @('vars-in-scope'), @('var-used-after') is not threaded through;
     it is simply passed down, and augmented as needed.
     The body of a lambda expression is evaluated after its actual arguments:
     thus, when marking the actual arguments of a lambda expression
     we must augment @('vars-used-after')
     with the free variables of the lambda expression,
     i.e. the free variables in the body minus the formal parameters.")
   (xdoc::p
    "As we mark the formal parameters of a lambda expression,
     we need to mark in the same way
     all the references to these variables in the body of the lambda expression.
     For this purpose, we pass around a mapping
     from (unmarked) variables to markings:
     this could be an alist from symbols to booleans,
     but we isomorphically use lists (treated as sets) of symbols instead,
     which are the variable marked as `new',
     while the variables not in the list are marked as `old'.
     When the term to be marked is a variable,
     we look it up in this list, and mark it accordingly.")

    "When the term to be marked is a quoted constant,
     it is obviously left unchanged.")
   (xdoc::p
    "When the term to be marked is a function application,
     we first treat the @(tsee if) (and @(tsee or)) case separately.
     We mark the test, and after that the two branches.
     The handling of @('vars-in-scope') and @('vars-used-after') for this case
     has been explained above.")
   (xdoc::p
    "For all other function applications, which are strict,
     we first mark the actual arguments,
     treating @('vars-in-scope') and @('vars-used-after')
     as explained above.
     For calls of named functions, we are done at this point:
     we put the named function in front of the marked arguments and return.
     For calls of lambda expression,
     we use the auxiliary function @('atj-mark-lambda-formals')
     to decide which formal parameters should be marked as `new' or `old'.
     We mark the parameter as `old' (indicating that the variable can be reused)
     iff the following three conditions hold.
     The first condition is that the variable must be in scope;
     note that variables have already been annotated with types at this point,
     and so by testing variable names we also test their types,
     which is needed for Java
     (i.e. we could not reuse a Java variable of type @('Acl2Symbol')
     to store a value of type @('Acl2String')).
     The second condition is that the variable is not used
     after the lambda application term, i.e. it is not in @('vars-used-after'):
     otherwise, we would overwrite something that was supposed to be used later,
     with incorrect results in general.
     The third condition is that the variable is not free
     in any of the actual arguments that correspond to
     the formal parameters of the lambda expression
     that come just after the one being marked:
     this is because, in the generated Java code,
     the lambda variables are assigned one after the other,
     and therefore we should not overwrite a variable
     that may be needed afterwards.
     For instance, consider a swap @('(let ((x y) (y x)) ...)'):
     @('x') cannot be reused
     (even if it is in scope and not used after the @(tsee let))
     because it must be assigned to @('y') after @('y') is assigned to @('x')
     (Java does not support parallel assignment);
     on the other hand, @('y') could be reused,
     if it is in scope and not used after the @(tsee let),
     because at the time of assigning to @('y')
     its (previous) value has already been assigned to @('x')."))
